# Netscore: 
With NetStats, you can generate statistics on your networks with a number of different functions, from generating basic network statistics on a paritcular network layer or multiplex to comparing individual networks against other networks or multiplexes. For example, if you have network layer acting as a gold set standard, you can use that network to test against another non-gold set network or multiplex to determine how closely related they are.  


## 1. Introduction
This document descibes the usage of RWR_netstats. This tool performs a suite of statistical tests on supplied networks. 

## 2. Setup
Unlike other functions in the RWRtoolkit, the `RWR_netscore` function does not necessarily requre an `mpo` R object for all of its functionality (however, many of its functions do require an mpo object). 

### Available Inputs:
The current setup of RWR netstats takes a 4 posible input values to generate statistics. 
- A path to an mpo rdata object
- A path to an flist
- A path to an edgelist

 Edgelists are evaluated as: `<Source> <Target> <Weight>`. It should be noted that for the sake of computational speed, the `flist` method does not create an actual multiplex object, but only mimics the multiplex itself (i.e. it does not create the supraadjacency matrix, nor its normalized counterpart).


In order to deomonstrate `RWR_netstats`, we will need to generate some networks. Let's generate 5 networks: 

1. 3 layers to act work together as a multiplex
2. 1 layer to act as a "gold standard" network. 
3. 1 layer to act as another network against which to test our gold standard.

### Network Layer Generation
```{r}

# a quick function for generating erdos.renyi layers
create_layer <- function(n_vertices, probaility, weights){
  # overwrite letters to contain letter combinations for more options
  EXTRALETTERS <- c(LETTERS, sapply(LETTERS, function(x) paste0(x, LETTERS)))
  layer <- igraph::erdos.renyi.game(n_vertices, probaility)
  layer <- set_vertex_attr(
              layer,
              "name",
              1:n_vertices,
              EXTRALETTERS[1:n_vertices]
            )
  layer
}

set.seed(42)

layer1 <- create_layer(30, 1/5) # will have vertices A - AD
layer2 <- create_layer(15, 1/4) # will have vertices A - O
layer3 <- create_layer(10, 1/3) # will have vertices A - J
ref_layer <- create_layer(10, 1/3) # will have vertices A - J 
interest_layer <- create_layer(20, 1/4) # will have vertices A - T 
```
### Writing Edgelists 
We now have 5 sample networks all with similar vertices, but randomly created edges. We can create a multiplex out of 3 of them, and use the fourth to act as a reference network, and the 5th to act as a standalone network of interest. Additionally, we want our edges to have weights, so we will add an additional vector to their edgelists: 

```{r}
layer1_edgelist <- igraph::as_edgelist(layer1)
layer2_edgelist <- igraph::as_edgelist(layer2)
layer3_edgelist <- igraph::as_edgelist(layer3)
ref_layer_edgelist <- igraph::as_edgelist(ref_layer)
interest_layer_edgelist <- igraph::as_edgelist(interest_layer)


# We need our edges to have weights:
layer1_edgelist <- cbind(layer1_edgelist, rep(1, igraph::ecount(layer1)))
layer2_edgelist <- cbind(layer2_edgelist, rep(1, igraph::ecount(layer2)))
layer3_edgelist <- cbind(layer3_edgelist, rep(1, igraph::ecount(layer3)))
ref_layer_edgelist <- cbind(ref_layer_edgelist, rep(1, igraph::ecount(ref_layer)))
interest_layer_edgelist <- cbind(interest_layer_edgelist, 
                                 rep(1, igraph::ecount(interest_layer))
                           )

# write to file: 
write.table(layer1_edgelist, file="layer1.tsv", quote=F, sep="\t", row.names = F, col.names = F)
write.table(layer2_edgelist, file="layer2.tsv", quote=F, sep="\t", row.names = F, col.names = F)
write.table(layer3_edgelist, file="layer3.tsv", quote=F, sep="\t", row.names = F, col.names = F)
write.table(ref_layer_edgelist, file="ref_layer.tsv", quote=F, sep="\t", row.names = F, col.names = F)
write.table(interest_layer_edgelist, file="interest_layer.tsv", quote=F, sep="\t", row.names = F, col.names = F)
```

### Creating an FLIST
With our files written to a edge lists we can now create an flist file to point to the first three: 
```{r}
file_paths <- c("layer1.tsv", "layer2.tsv", "layer3.tsv")
layer_names <- c("layer1", "layer2", "layer3")
groups <- c(1, 1, 1)

flist_df <- data.frame(list(
              filepaths = file_paths,
              layernames = layer_names,
              groups = groups
            ))

flist_filename <- "./multiplex_flist.tsv"
write.table(flist_df, file = flist_filename, quote = F, sep = "\t", row.names = F, col.names = F)
```

### Creating the Multiplex
Finally, we need to create our multiplex to use many of the functions offered within RWR_netstats:
```{r}
multiplex_filepath <- "./mutliplex.Rdata"
RWRtoolkit::RWR_make_multiplex(
                  flist_filename, 
                  output = multiplex_filepath)
```
Note: It's often the case the the creation of the multiplex values takes quite a long while. In this case, it's often best to use the `flist` parameter when calculating the statistics, as the all of the statistics calculated within the `RWR_netstats` function are calculated without making use of the supra-adjacency matrices.


## 4. Running RWR Netstats
### Base Network Statistics
When running `RWR_netstats`, there are many optoins we can use. All options (beyond the networks themselves) require only a boolean flag. First, to obtain base statistics for a given network layer or multiplex we simply use the `base_statistics` flag. This returns a dataframe for network containing the **number of nodes** in the network, the **edge count** and the network's **diameter**: 
```{r}
reflayer_filename <- "./ref_layer.tsv"
netstats <- RWRtoolkit::RWR_netstats(
  data = multiplex_filepath, 
  network_1 = reflayer_filename,
  basic_statistics = TRUE,
)


print("Base Statistics Net 1:")
print(netstats$base_stats_net1)

print("Multiplex Base Statistics:")
print(netstats$base_stats_mpo)
```

### Pairwise Layer Comparisons
With `RWR_netstats` we can compare networks by calculating jaccard similarity coefficient or overlap scores with respect to the shared edges between the networks of interest. 

When calculating the jaccard similarity coefficient between two layers (or two networks) A and B, we create sets of their edges: 

$$
jaccard(A,B) = \frac{E(A) \cap E(B)}{ E(A) \cup E(B) }
$$

The overlap scoring considers the weights of the network edges that exist in both the reference network (A) and the network of interest (B), divided by the total number of edges within the network of interest: 

$$
\hspace{2ex} overlap(A,B) = \frac{\sum_{e \in E(C)} W_{e} }{ | E(B) | }
    $\begin{cases}  
        C = A \cap B 
    \end{cases}$
$$

The `scoring_metric` parameter defines whether `jaccard` or `overlap` are used for scoring, however both methods can be employed by supplying `both` to the parameter. For the remainder of this vignette, we'll use `both`. 
#### Comparing Two Separate Networks
To compare two individual networks, we'll use our `ref_layer` and our `interest_layer_edgelist`. 

```{r}
refnet_path <- "./ref_layer.tsv"
interest_net_path <- "./interest_layer.tsv"
netstats <- RWRtoolkit::RWR_netstats(
  network_1 = refnet_path,
  network_2 = interest_net_path, 
  net_to_net_similarity = T,
  scoring_parameter = "both",
)

netstats
```

#### Comparing Pairwise Metrics for All Layers of a Multiplex
You'll likely wish to compare each of the layers within a multiplex network as well, this can be done using `pairwise_between_mpo_layer` flag to obtain the pairwise overlap scores. : 


```{r}
netstats <- RWRtoolkit::RWR_netstats(
  data = multiplex_filepath, 
  pairwise_between_mpo_layer = T, 
  scoring_metric = "both"
)
print("The pairwise Jaccard Similarity Coefficients:")
netstats$pairwise_between_mpo_layer_jaccard

print("The pairwise overlap scores are:")
netstats$pairwise_between_mpo_layer_overlap
```

#### Comparing All Layers of a Multiplex against a Reference Network
Just as you can compare a single layer to a reference network, it's also possible to compare all layers against a reference network by supplying the reference network as `network_1`: 

```{r}
netstats <- RWRtoolkit::RWR_netstats(
  data = multiplex_filepath, 
  network_1 = refnet_path,
  multiplex_layers_to_refnet = T, 
  scoring_metric = "both"
)

print("The Jaccard Similarity Coefficients between the reference network and the multiplex are:")
netstats$multiplex_layers_to_refnet_jaccard
```
```{r}

print("The pairwise overlap scores between the reference network and the multiplex are:")
netstats$multiplex_layers_to_refnet_overlap
```

### Calculating Network Statistics
#### Calculating Tau
With `RWR_netstats` it is also possible to calculate a `tau` vector for a particular multiplex given a reference network. This method takes the overlap score of each layer with respect to its reference layer, normalizes those scores (such that all scores sum to one), and then multiples said scores by the total number of layers. 

```{r}
netstats <- RWRtoolkit::RWR_netstats(
  data = multiplex_filepath, 
  network_1 = refnet_path,
  calculate_tau_for_mpo = T
)

print("The calculated tau vector for our multiplex with respect to the reference network is: ")
print(netstats$calculated_tau)
```

#### Calculating Exclusivity:
Not all networks will have similar edges. By calculating the exclusivity of a multiplex's network layers, you can calculate the proportion of all edges in the multiplex that are found in each layer: 

```{r}
netstats <- RWRtoolkit::RWR_netstats(
  data = multiplex_filepath, 
  calculate_exclusivity_for_mpo = T
)

netstats$exclusivity
```


### Merging Networks
#### Collapsing a Multiplex Network
It's not impossibe that you'll at some point with to collapse down your multiplex network into a multigraph (such that all edges exist within the same topological layer): 

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
netstats <- RWRtoolkit::RWR_netstats(
  data = multiplex_filepath, 
  merged_with_all_edges = T
)
merged_layers <- netstats$merged_with_all_edges$merged_network
n_colors <- length(unique(E(merged_layers)$type))
pal <- brewer.pal(n_colors, "Set2")
names(pal) <- unique(E(merged_layers)$type)
E(merged_layers)$color <- unlist(lapply(E(merged_layers)$type, function(x) pal[[x]]))

png('merged_with_all_edges.png', width=1000, height=1000, res=300)
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
set.seed(42)
coords <- layout_with_kk(merged_layers)
igraph::plot.igraph(merged_layers, layout=coords, main="Merged With All Edges", vertex.size=18)
legend('topleft',legend=names(pal), fill=pal, cex=1/3)
dev.off()

knitr::include_graphics('merged_with_all_edges.png')
```

#### Simplifying a Multiplex
It may also be the case that you wish to simplify your multiplex into a single network, but with only one possible edge between any two nodes. We can do this with `merged_with_edgecounts`, but in this function, all edge weights between any two nodes i and j are a reflection of how many total edges existed between i and j within the multiplex: 
```{r, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
netstats <- RWRtoolkit::RWR_netstats(
  data = multiplex_filepath, 
  merged_with_edgecounts = T
)

edgecount_layer <- netstats$merged_with_edgecounts$merged_network
n_colors <- length(unique(E(edgecount_layer)$weight))
pal <- brewer.pal(n_colors, "Set2")
names(pal) <- unique(E(edgecount_layer)$weight)
E(edgecount_layer)$color <- unlist(lapply(E(edgecount_layer)$weight, function(x) pal[[x]]))

png('merged_with_all_edges.png', width=1000, height=1000, res=300)
par(mar=c(1,1,1,1))
set.seed(42)
coords <- layout_with_kk(edgecount_layer)
igraph::plot.igraph(edgecount_layer, layout=coords, main="Merged With All Edges", vertex.size=15)
legend('topleft',
       legend=paste(names(pal)[order(names(pal), decreasing=F)], "edge(s)"),
       fill=pal[order(names(pal), decreasing=F)], cex=1/3) 

dev.off()

knitr::include_graphics('merged_with_all_edges.png')

```
