# RWRtools

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

RWRtools enables easy use of RandomWalk with Restart on multiplex networks.  These functions are an extension to the [RandomWalkRestartMH](https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/RandomWalkRestartMH) R package.  Also provided are scripts for use as command line tools.


## Installation

##### Dependencies
Installation of this R package requires R and r-devtools.  If you use prefer the use of conda you can create the base environment with `conda create --name r-rwrtools -c conda-forge r-base r-devtools`.  You can also install devtools from within a base R environment with `install.packages("devtools")`.

##### Primary Method
You may clone this repo and install directly.  This is particularly useful to use the CLI scripts or for development purposes.

```
git clone https://github.com/dkainer/RWRtools.git
cd RWRtools
git checkout packageAttempt1
R
devtools::install()
```

From a clean environment this may take a while (~20 min).


##### Secondary Method (install as an R package directly)
*Note: this method is not yet available for general use as repository is private.*  You can install the released version of RWRtools from [GitHub](https://github.com/dkainer/RWRtools/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("dkainer/RWRtools")
```

*Note: add in details about where to find the CLI scripts in /bin/library ??*

## Running RWRtools
### General:
RWRtools enables RandomWalk with Restart (RWR) on both homogenous and heterogeneous multiplex networks.  A heterogeneous network is used when integrating multiple network sources; for example in building a multiplex network with a gene-to-gene network and a disease-to-disease networks and combining them by defining a gene-to-disease network which serves as the bi-partite edges.  RWRtools provides functions for both creating the muliplex networks and running RWR.

### Usage Options:
The tools provided by RWRtools can be used either directly in R or by use of command line scripts.  The R functions follow the convention of `RWRtools::RWR_func` such as `RWRtools::RWR_make_multiplex`.  View help with `?RWRtools::RWR_make_multiplex`.  The command line scripts are available in `./inst/scripts` and can be used with `Rscript` such as `Rscript run_make_multiplex.R`.  Run `Rscript run_make_multiplex.R -h` to view the help.  You can use these scripts from any location, but remember to either use complete paths or paths local to where you are running when applicable.

### Inital Step: 

The first step in RWRtools is to build the RData object that represents the multiplex network using `RWR_make_multiplex`.  This function requires an `flist` (a **f**ile **list**) input file which represents the set of networks to create the multiplex object.  Each row in the flist is a triple defining the network: \{file_path, name, group\}.  In a homogenous network the group is all `1`.  In a heterogeneous network, one set of networks will use `1` (e.g. gene-to-gene), the other will use `2` (e.g. disease-to-disease), and `3` for the connecting network (e.g. gene-to-disease).  An example flist for a homegenous networks looks like (seperated by any of the following delimiters  `,\t |;`):

|      **file_path**     |    **name**   | **group** |
|:----------------------:|:-------------:|:---------:|
| /path/to/file1.txt     | PPI           | 1         |
| /path/to/file2.txt     | Co-Domain     | 1         |

At this stage you also define values for delta and lambda.  **Delta** sets the probability to change between layers at the next step. If delta = 0, the particle will always remain in the same layer after a non-restart iteration.  On the other hand, if delta = 1, the particle will always change between layers, therefore not following the specific edges of each layer.  The default is 0.5.  Note delta must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.

**Lambda** is for heterogeneous networks only.  When building a heterogeneous network (i.e. multiple layer groups connected with bipartite links), the walker can jump between layer groups with probability = lambda when it is at a node with a bipartite link. If lambda=1 then walker will oscillate between groups every time it is at a node with a bipartite link.  Default is 0.5.

Please note that for large networks or a large number of networks this function may take a long time.

This function will not return anything, it will save the relevant objects (the multiplex object *mpo*, adjacency matrix, and normalized adjacency matrix) to file to be used in subsequent functions.

When using the CLI script, remember to use complete paths or paths local to where you run `scripts/run_make_multiplex.R` in your `flist`.

Examples

- **Running in R**

    ```
    RWRtools::RWR_make_multiplex(
      flist="./inst/example_data/flist.tsv",
      delta=0.25,
      lambda=0.75, 
      output="./outdir/myExampleNetwork.Rdata"
    )
    ```

- **Running CLI**

    ```
    Rscript run_make_multiplex.R 
      --flist tests/testSTRINGDB/flist.tsv \
      --delta 0.25,
      --lambda 0.75,
      --out ./outdir/myExampleNetwork.Rdata
    ```

### Next Steps: 
The choice of the next script depends on the type of analysis desired.
RWRtools provides several different workflows outlined below.


#### RWR_CV.R

*RWR Cross Validation* performs K-fold cross validation on a single gene
set, finding the RWR rank of the left-out genes.  Can choose between three
modes: (1) leave-one-out `loo` to leave only one gene from the gene set out and
find its rank, (2) cross-validation `kfold` to run k-fold cross-validation 
for a specified value of *k*, or (3) singletons `singletons` to use a single gene
as a seed and find the rank of all remaining genes.

- **Input:** Pre-calculated interaction network (using
  `RWR_make_multiplex.R`), and a single geneset.
- **Output:** Table/dataframe with the ranking of each gene in the gene set when
  left out, as well as AUPRC and AUROC curves.

Examples

- **Running in R**

    ```
    RWRtools::RWR_CV(
      dataPath="./inst/example_data/string_interactions.Rdata",
      genesetPath="./inst/example_data/geneset1.txt",
      outdirPath="./outdir")
    ```

- **Running CLI**

    ```
    Rscript run_cv.R
      --data ./inst/example_data/string_interactions.Rdata \
      --geneset ./inst/example_data/geneset1.txt \
      -o ./outdir
    ```

#### RWR_LOE.R

*RWR Lines of Evidence* has two possible functions.  Given one geneset 
of seeds, rankings for all other genes in the network will be returned. 
Given a second geneset of genes to be queried, rankings for just the genes 
in that geneset will be returned.  This can be used to build multiple 
lines of evidence from the various input networks to relate the two gene sets.

- **Input:** Pre-calculated interaction network (using
  `RWR_make_multiplex`), and one or two genesets.
- **Output:** Table/dataframe with a ranking of non-seed genes (either the rest of the genes in the network if only one input geneset is used, or just the genes in the second geneset if one is provided).
  
Examples

- **Running in R**

    ```
    RWRtools::RWR_LOE(
      data="./inst/example_data/string_interactions.Rdata",
      seed_geneset="./inst/example_data/geneset1.txt",
      tau="1.0,1.0",
      outdir="./outdir")
    ```

- **Running CLI**

    ```
    Rscript run_loe.R 
      --data            ./inst/example_data/string_interactions.Rdata \
      --seed_geneset    ./inst/example_data/geneset1.txt \
      --tau             "1.0,1.0" \
      -o                ./outdir
    ```

#### RWR_netscore.R

*RWR Net Score*  performs a network intersect between an input network (`network`) 
and a gold truth network (`gold`), e.g. the GO network. It will score the strength 
of the intersect with multiple metrics.

- **Input:**
    - A gold standard network as reference.
    - Another network to compare to the gold standard.
- **Output:** A table containing multiple metrics including the edge intersect 
between the input network and the gold standard network.


    
Examples

- **Running in R**

    ```
    RWRtools::RWR_netscore(
      gold="./inst/example_data/netscore/combined_score-random-gold.tsv",
      network="./inst/example_data/netscore/combined_score-random-test.tsv",
      outdir="./outdir")
    ```

- **Running CLI**

    ```
    Rscript run_loe.R \
      --gold    ./inst/example_data/netscore/combined_score-random-gold.tsv \
      --network ./inst/example_data/netscore/combined_score-random-test.tsv \
      --outdir  ./outdir
    ```


#### RWR_shortestpaths.R

Find shortest paths between genes in gene sets. Given a single gene
set, find the shortest paths between the genes in that gene set. Given
two gene sets, find the shortest paths for pairs of genes between gene
sets.

- **Input:**
    - Pre-calculated interaction network (`data`).  The layers will be flattened into a single network to find the shortest paths.
    - A file in TSV format containing genes of interest (`source-geneset`).
    - Optional second file in TSV format containing genes of
      interest (`target-geneset`) to find pairs of paths to the `source-geneset`.
- **Output:** Edge list table.

Examples

- **Running in R**

    ```
    RWRtools::RWR_ShortestPaths(
        data="./inst/example_data/string_interactions.Rdata",
        source_geneset="./inst/example_data/geneset1.txt",
        target_geneset="./inst/example_data/geneset2.txt",
        outdir="./outdir"
    )
    ```

- **Running CLI**

    ```
    Rscript run_shortestpaths.R \
        --data ./inst/example_data/string_interactions.Rdata \
        --source-geneset ./inst/example_data/geneset1.txt \
        --target-geneset ./inst/example_data/geneset2.txt \
        -o ./outdir
    ```
